                Hello, my name is Mr. Sittpon Marprow, and I am 17 years old, currently studying at Triamudomsuksapattanakarn Nonthaburi School.
                My passion for learning has led me to develop a strong interest in various fields, particularly in computer science, which I find truly captivating.Since childhood, I have always felt excited about learning new things. Whether it’s reading books, conducting science experiments, or programming, my curiosity drives me to constantly seek out additional knowledge. I often explore online courses and engage in small projects on my own to further enhance my skills.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For me, learning is not just about getting good grades in school; it’s about discovering new ideas and developing various skills that will help me grow in the future. I actively participate in technology-related activities, such as coding competitions and computer clubs, which allow me to meet friends who share similar interests.Looking ahead, I am determined to pursue a degree in computer science, with the goal of creating software that is both useful and positively impacts society. I believe that the journey of learning is endless, and I am ready to embrace new challenges to fulfill my dreams.
            </p> 
            
            <p>
                When I look back to the age of 14, a time when my world was filled with fun and adventure, I realize that my interest in programming began to sprout in my heart. However, at that time, the allure of friends kept me from fully dedicating myself to this passion. Nevertheless, as I stepped into 16, I decided to search for my true path and began studying programming seriously.From that point on, the joy of coding began to fill my life. Working on small projects with friends was exhilarating; every line of code felt like creating something new that had never existed before. Eventually, we decided to participate in programming competitions, which became a significant milestone in my life.My first competition was an experience filled with excitement and challenges. Facing a variety of problems required us to use both our skills and creativity to find solutions. I realized it wasn’t just a competition; it was a journey of self-discovery.During the competition, I met new people who shared my interests. The atmosphere was buzzing with enthusiasm, as everyone focused on their tasks and exchanged knowledge joyfully. It made me feel that we were not just a group of individuals, but a community united by a common commitment and inspiration.
                
                In addition, I had the opportunity to attend a camp organized for those interested in programming. This camp not only allowed us to learn from experts but also made me feel like I was in a vibrant place filled with support. Participating in various workshops helped me acquire new skills and build valuable relationships.   
            </p>
            <p>
                Every experience from participating in competitions and camps helped me truly discover my passion in this field. It was the challenges and collaboration with others that fueled my love for programming and motivated me to continue developing myself in the future, along with the hope of creating something new in this world.
